        <p>Overall, the assignment went well as very early on as we allocated tasks to each team member evenly splitting the workload. This ensured that from the begging we knew what we each needed to do allowing us to set clear goals on when certain subtasks had to be completed by. In terms of what could be improved is getting more work done during the first few weeks while we did a moderate amount of work, we could have significantly lightened our workload if we did more work earlier rather than later. One thing that was surprising was that what seemed like a lot of work initially was actually not that much once it was divided showcasing the advantage of having 6 people in our group. I have learned that the most important thing to do to ensure success when working in a group is communication. This is because communication allows everyone to be kept on the same page about what needs to be done and what has been done ensuring maximum efficiency and effectiveness of the time spent working. I think that the content of Github commits reflect group members work not the number of them as obviously those working on the website will have way more commits that those purely focusing on writing up the content.</p>
