        <h2>Lachlan M:</h2>
        <p>I think generally the team worked quite well together, in large part due to our good planning & organization. I slotted into a project manager role in lieu of anyone else stepping up, and mostly focused on that as well as developing the majority of the website. I think we could have done better by setting due dates for work that could have been completed earlier, and enforcing them. A good amount of work was finalized and merged in the last week of the project, and I think it would have made things a lot easier to get that done a week or two beforehand during the Easter break. I was pleasantly surprised to see how well everyone communicated throughout the whole project. Meeting attendance was almost flawless, and we were in constant communication about updates to the project.
        <br><br>
        I think I’ve learned just how much a good organizational system, with deadlines can make a difference in a group project like this. I think we were quite good in this regard, but could have been even better. 
        <br><br>
        I’ve added a couple of tools to our project management workflow to help us keep track of the team’s work. These tools were a Trello Board<sup><a href="references.html">[38]</a></sup> and a Microsoft Teams/Github Integration plugin<sup><a href="references.html">[39]</a></sup> that notifies the group when changes to the website have been made. Together I think these have helped us quite a bit in keeping track of tasks & their progress. I also think that due to the nature of how our workflow regarding the website was planned, the Github log activity is not a perfect way of measuring work from the team on the assignment. The majority of commits have been from me, as I was in charge of setting up the layout & structure of the site as well as adding placeholder content for the rest of the team to replace with their work. Because of this, the number of commits indicate a disproportionate amount of work was done by me, which absolutely is not the case. I felt we all shared the workload of the project very equally.

        <p>Within assignment 2 I worked on the IT technologies, overall, the write up went well with multiple sources found to develop an in depth write up. In addition, I believe our communication as a group was very good, everyone attending the meeting regularly and giving updates on teams when unable to attend the meetings, allowing us to know where everyone was up to. One thing that I believe could be improved for our group was to get everyone from the start to work off teams to track their progress rather than working off a personal word file but in the end, we were able to ensure everyone was on track. One thing I found surprising throughout the IT technologies write-up was the amount of development with the autonomous vehicles and the level of testing that is currently being done. One thing that I learned working in the group is that communication is vital as it allows everyone to know where everyone was up to and progress making it easier to hit our deadlines. Also, with good communication it ensures everyone knows what needs to be done and highlights any issues a team member may have. The GitHub commits I’ve done relatively reflect the work I’ve done but it wasn’t my main task developing the website, only inputting the work I’ve completed. </p>

        <p>Overall, the assignment went well as very early on as we allocated tasks to each team member evenly splitting the workload. This ensured that from the begging we knew what we each needed to do allowing us to set clear goals on when certain subtasks had to be completed by. In terms of what could be improved is getting more work done during the first few weeks while we did a moderate amount of work, we could have significantly lightened our workload if we did more work earlier rather than later. One thing that was surprising was that what seemed like a lot of work initially was actually not that much once it was divided showcasing the advantage of having 6 people in our group. I have learned that the most important thing to do to ensure success when working in a group is communication. This is because communication allows everyone to be kept on the same page about what needs to be done and what has been done ensuring maximum efficiency and effectiveness of the time spent working. I think that the content of Github commits reflect group members work not the number of them as obviously those working on the website will have way more commits that those purely focusing on writing up the content.</p>
