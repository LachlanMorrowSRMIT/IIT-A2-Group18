        <h4>[Can you introduce yourself for us?</h4>
        <p>[My name is Daniel Paley, and I am the Lead System Architect at Eloque. In my career that spans 30 odd years, I’ve done a lot of different things such as chip design, database application programming, embedded programing as well systems programming. When I was at school it was called Unix and not Linux, I’ve done an awful lot with that and would still rather have a Unix box than anything else. I worked at companies that did very high-end RF stuff, I wrote some of the world specs for RFID for the 100-megahertz worldwide RFID little key fobs. I am the only person in the in the world that worked on both the hardware and the software for the 900-megahertz stuff. I did almost all the verification of their Rambus membership singlehanded I had two other guys help but I did all the verification to make sure that that memory worked. I worked on the Nintendo 64, I did almost all of the verification of the RAM bus verification singlehanded, I had two other guys help but I did all the verification to make sure that memory worked. I think that my friends would describe me as the quintessential geek, I look at everything technical and just love it.
        </p>

        <h4>What distributions of Linux/Unix are you familiar with?</h4>
        <p>[UCB Linux or Unix rather, Berkley 4.1… I still have the Devil Book sitting on the bookshelf somewhere and I believe I have a full set of them somewhere, they’re heirlooms now though. I run Ubuntu now for the most part. I use a lot of different distributions; I’ve even created some of my own. I’ve done low level programming and device programing with Linux which is a lot of fun if you’ve never done it. I’ve written all the way from machine code all the way up to patient programs, graphics programs, websites, and things like that. I’ve haven’t done a lot of mechanical engineering, but I was responsible for some of that stuff, as well as [RFID] and analog/digital stuff as well. </p>

        <h4>Can you give us a description about your job, role, the industry you work in and what you do in your everyday work?</h4>
        <p>I came into Eloque as the Lead Designer for the Edge computer system, which essentially monitors the health of infrastructure. We attach optic fiber to a bridge and as it flexes and moves around, it changes the light and the frequency of what was returned which determines if there is structural damage or if it is weakening. I don’t deal with that or the optical stuff, but there’s a component called an Optical Interrogation Unit which gets the raw information and turns it into digital information and floating-point numbers, I'm in control and in charge of that box and the interpreting equipment; that’s my domain. Around four or five months ago I hired someone I had worked with for over 20 years to come in and help to manage that. We designed a board to aid in that computation we need to do so we can process it through the cellular network.
        <br>
        My day to day right now can consist of a wide range of things. Today we had a debacle. I guess you could say where we changed some values that we shouldn't have changed on a production system. If we've been working in the test environment, it wouldn't have been a problem. But as I had to go figure out what happened, right, we saw a bunch of data. We saw a very sketchy set of data on the servers, and it was my job to go figure out what happened and how to resolve that. So essentially anything that goes wrong, I must be responsible for it and understand it. On some days is that means I get to sit and a read and write code for have new optical interrogator. We're checking out that came from a different partner. It has a different protocol. I'm used to being in an embedded world, you know, where it's very dirty, noisy, and terrible, so we have to take some really nice equipment and move it there. We're working with lots of different companies and people to redesign their system to fit into a harsher environment, which entails a lot of redundancy and things you wouldn't normally do, which they haven't thought of. 
        <br>
        I have the experience to understand all the parts of the system to be able to solve it. We don't know. One day I'm writing code. The next day I'm dealing with management issues. Another day I'm trying to figure out how we purchased equipment which right now is unattainable. You know, another day I'm dealing with the supplier that screwed something up and we must get it fixed. You know? It's a wide range of things, but then again, you know my goals are split between managing people and getting to understand the flow of our systems.
