        <h2>Cybersecurty:</h2>

        <h3>What does it do?</h3>
        <p>Cybersecurity is the overall concept of protecting different electronic data in servers, and personal computers and the ways we can take actions to achieve this protection. These actions are used to prevent hackers from gaining access to important data and information such as a company’s customers information including credit card details and personal information such as their address.   

There are many threats that cybersecurity deals with, some common one’s include malware, ransomware, and phishing attacks. Malware also known as viruses are software that are created to cause harm this can be done by the user simply clicking a link. Ransomware is a form of malware by as the name suggests the hacker requests a ransom for the company to have access to their systems. Phishing is typically presented as an email such as pretending to be as a bank requesting credit card information.   

 

To deal with this, cybersecurity includes many technologies that are vital for protecting personal computers to organizations. Some simple technology includes antivirus software which its key role is to detect and remove malicious items on a computer/laptop some antivirus software include Avast, McAfee, and Norton. Another technology used in cybersecurity is DNS filtering which is a technology that allows the user to ensure the domain they are accessing to be free of malicious content, it acts as a filter for different website domains to determine whether it is ‘good’ or ‘bad.’ DNS filtering is also used by organizations to prevent their workers from entering a specific site that could cause cybersecurity threats.  

 

There are many types of cybersecurity this includes operational security, application security, network security and cloud security.   

 

Operational security consists of a plan for all cybersecurity risks. Usually created by a risk management officer that created a plan to ensure user’s data stored in a company’s server is secure even if an attack occurs. Some security practices used are making sure the employees of a company are well educated about cybersecurity threats.  

 

Application security consists of the protection for applications we install on our personal devices. Some security practices currently used include a password from a user and using dual factor authentication.   

 

Network security involves the protection of the network users and company’s use. It ensures only authorized users can access the network and block hackers/attackers. Some of the techniques used to protect against the network include firewalls also network attacks can usually come in the form as a phishing attack sent via email and could pose a risk to a business’s network thus email security is additionally important in network security.  

 

Cloud security involves the protection of everything we store in the cloud, services such as OneDrive and Google Drive, also the protection for major organizations cloud servers. Some of the security practices used currently include ensuring the user’s network is secure, multiple options to back-up the data stored on the cloud and different encryption techniques.   

 

All these different areas within cybersecurity are dealt with many professionals within the field including cybersecurity specialists, cybersecurity analysts, cybersecurity engineer and network engineer.   

 

So right now, cybersecurity can currently do a lot including protecting individual computers and organizations confidential data, but currently it is increasingly difficult for law enforcement to prosecute these cybercrimes. However, what is the future of cybersecurity, currently the employment rate for cybersecurity specialists is not at a high level and not filling the positions required which could change with the current trends in cybersecurity. Some threats are planned to or are in trend include malware automation, polymorphic malware, and third-party software which could contain imbedded malware that could target the company’s system. In addition, the use of Internet of Things threats is continually increasing due to the continuous increase of individuals owning their own personal devices thus, in the future cybersecurity would focus a lot on the Internet of Things attacks.   </p>
