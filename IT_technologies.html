        <h2>Cybersecurty:</h2>

        <h3>What does it do?</h3>
        <p>Cybersecurity is the overall concept of protecting different electronic data in servers, and personal computers and the ways we can take actions to achieve this protection. These actions are used to prevent hackers from gaining access to important data and information such as a company’s customers information including credit card details and personal information such as their address.   
<br> <br>
There are many threats that cybersecurity deals with, some common one’s include malware, ransomware, and phishing attacks. Malware also known as viruses are software that are created to cause harm this can be done by the user simply clicking a link. Ransomware is a form of malware by as the name suggests the hacker requests a ransom for the company to have access to their systems. Phishing is typically presented as an email such as pretending to be as a bank requesting credit card information.   
<br> <br>
To deal with this, cybersecurity includes many technologies that are vital for protecting personal computers to organizations. Some simple technology includes antivirus software which its key role is to detect and remove malicious items on a computer/laptop some antivirus software include Avast, McAfee, and Norton. Another technology used in cybersecurity is DNS filtering which is a technology that allows the user to ensure the domain they are accessing to be free of malicious content, it acts as a filter for different website domains to determine whether it is ‘good’ or ‘bad.’ DNS filtering is also used by organizations to prevent their workers from entering a specific site that could cause cybersecurity threats.  
<br> <br>
There are many types of cybersecurity this includes operational security, application security, network security and cloud security. 
<br> <br>
Operational security consists of a plan for all cybersecurity risks. Usually created by a risk management officer that created a plan to ensure user’s data stored in a company’s server is secure even if an attack occurs. Some security practices used are making sure the employees of a company are well educated about cybersecurity threats.  
<br> <br>
Application security consists of the protection for applications we install on our personal devices. Some security practices currently used include a password from a user and using dual factor authentication.   
<br> <br>
Network security involves the protection of the network users and company’s use. It ensures only authorized users can access the network and block hackers/attackers. Some of the techniques used to protect against the network include firewalls also network attacks can usually come in the form as a phishing attack sent via email and could pose a risk to a business’s network thus email security is additionally important in network security.  
<br> <br>
Cloud security involves the protection of everything we store in the cloud, services such as OneDrive and Google Drive, also the protection for major organizations cloud servers. Some of the security practices used currently include ensuring the user’s network is secure, multiple options to back-up the data stored on the cloud and different encryption techniques.   
<br> <br>
All these different areas within cybersecurity are dealt with many professionals within the field including cybersecurity specialists, cybersecurity analysts, cybersecurity engineer and network engineer.   
<br> <br>
So right now, cybersecurity can currently do a lot including protecting individual computers and organizations confidential data, but currently it is increasingly difficult for law enforcement to prosecute these cybercrimes. However, what is the future of cybersecurity, currently the employment rate for cybersecurity specialists is not at a high level and not filling the positions required which could change with the current trends in cybersecurity. Some threats are planned to or are in trend include malware automation, polymorphic malware, and third-party software which could contain imbedded malware that could target the company’s system. In addition, the use of Internet of Things threats is continually increasing due to the continuous increase of individuals owning their own personal devices thus, in the future cybersecurity would focus a lot on the Internet of Things attacks. </p>

        <h2>Raspberry Pis, Arduinos, Makey Makeys and other small computing devices:</h2>

        <h3>What does it do?</h3>
        <p>Throughout the recent years, there have been many “emerging small computing devices that provide an accessible and easy way for software developers” (Sandhu, 2021) to start learning how to use various pieces of hardware to collect inputs and produce outputs. These computing devices include Arduino boards, Raspberry Pis and a variety of other “beginner hardware invention kits” (Makey Makey, 2022). Arduino is an open-source electronics platform which utilizes various hardware components including a single-board microcontroller (What is Arduino?, 2018). The main reason Arduino is so easy to learn is due to the large community surrounding it, this results in a large knowledge base and abundance of resources that beginners can draw from when learning the platform (What is Arduino?, 2018). Raspberry Pi on the other hand is a “microprocessor-based minicomputer” (What is Arduino?, 2018) which usually runs using a Linux based OS. In comparison to Arduino, a Raspberry Pi can “run multiple programs at once” (Earl, n.d.) making it better suited to more complex projects partly also due to its “better processor allowing for more complex computations to take place” (Raspberry Pi vs. Arduino: Which One is Best (for Beginners)?, n.d.). Many other small computing devices perform similar functions to both Raspberries Pis and Arduinos such as BeagleBoard, Sharks Cove, Nanode etc. However, Arduinos and Raspberries Pis are by far the most widely used and recognised ones due to both ease of use and accessibility. 

 

The applications for both Arduinos and Raspberry Pis are quite endless as they can be used in all sorts of DIY projects (Teja, 2021) from home automation to simple robotics. This is achieved through various sensors and modules (Sensors & Modules, 2021) that can be used in conjunction with them to either detect inputs or perform an output. One example of an individual who largely utilizes these devices to create interesting projects is Youtuber Michael Reeves who often uses both Arduinos and Raspberry Pis to program a wide variety of robotics. An example is when he made a Roomba that screams when bumping into various objects, this was achieved using a Raspberry Pi with a couple of optical sensors and a Bluetooth speaker. This shows how these devices can be utilized to produce output when certain inputs are detected by sensors for a wide variety of applications (19). Also, these devices allow people not familiar with the hardware aspect of programming to become exposed to the hardware and start learning how to use it to complete a wide variety of tasks. This allows them to build their knowledge using these beginner systems until they are comfortable enough to take what they have learned and apply it to the more complex hardware used in the industry. 

 

In the future, these devices are expected to be able to continue to lower the cost of development using minicomputer and microcontrollers to make them more accessible to both hobbyists (Gunjal, 2018) but also give developing countries access to these computing devices allowing them to modernise. This could include the implementation of “low-cost PLC controllers” for example which will help industrial automation (What is PLC ? Programmable Logic Controller - Unitronics, n.d.) reducing the amount of physical labour required in third world countries and help them localize manufacturing. Additionally, Arduino in the future once it becomes more efficient is going to allow companies to make products that are more easily customizable by consumers. For example, if someone buys a product and wishes it had an additional feature or if a current feature acted differently, they could take it into their own hands and program the new feature themselves. This would be possible due to the open-source nature of Arduino meaning that it acts the same across multiple products.  </p>

        <h3>What is the likely impact?</h3>
        <p>The impact of technologies such as Arduino, Raspberry Pis and other small computing devices is the increasing number of people that are going to start using hardware to solve problems they encounter in their everyday life. As we have seen over the last decade ever since the release and popularisation of these devices due to their ease of use and low entry cost more and more people than ever are deciding to create their own DIY projects using these tools as opposed to other microcontrollers/minicomputers which require extensive knowledge to use effectively. I could see this push for accessibility go even further with methods to program Arduinos and Rasberry Pis without any programming knowledge in the future so anyone could use them regardless of education. I think the people most affected by these devices will be the future generations that are interested in technology as it will allow them to start experimenting and making their own ideas with very little prerequisite knowledge being needed. 

 

I also think that if products start implementing these open-source components it will allow consumers to have so much more freedom in modifying what they buy whether they want to change how it works or replace a broken component. Also, it will allow people who aren’t software engineering graduates etc. to develop and sell technology products that they come up with. As with any hardware that can potentially automate tasks there is a risk that this could impact manual labour jobs through the automation of mundane tasks. However, I believe that workers can work alongside these automated systems and due to the lower cost and increased efficiency it results in more workers needed to meet the demand (Gaskell, 2021).  I don’t think these accessible devices will replace regular microcontrollers and other more complex devices currently due to them having advantages in terms of space and energy efficiency which is a major factor in commercial products. </p>

        <h3>How will this effect you?</h3>
        <p>This technology will affect me by providing me with an accessible way to start learning and creating hardware projects. This means with my already acquired IT knowledge I could start solving any problems I come across in my daily life developing hardware solutions for them and if found to be viable could be escalated into a business idea. This technology due to its low cost and ease of development will also mean that I can develop many prototypes to quickly get ideas into a tangible state. Aside from how this technology will affect me from a developer's point of view, there is also how it will affect me as a consumer. As a consumer if products start to feature Arduinos it will allow me to tinker and modify them additionally allows for me to replace broken components of a product much more easily. 

 

Due to the open-source nature, it will be easy for me to learn platforms such as Arduino and Raspberry Pi. This is because there are large communities surrounding each platform resulting in a lot of resources to learn from this means I will have a lot of past examples to learn from when making my own DIY projects and using these resources to circumvent any errors that may come across. Ultimately this means I will spend less time learning how to use the platform and more time using it to create stuff for a lack of a better term. 

 

This technology will make it so that my friends and family members who are interested in DIY projects are more willing to implement microcontrollers and minicomputers into their projects as the barrier of entry to start using these computing devices is not high. Also if I use these devices to create something that benefits one of my family members or friends it means that the hardware as indirectly positively affected them as it allowed me to create it. </p>
