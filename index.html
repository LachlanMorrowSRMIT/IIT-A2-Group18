        <p>Hi! My name is Lachlan Morrow (s3942121@student.rmit.edu.au). I’m 24, and was born & raised in Victoria, Australia, though my family is of Irish heritage. My only spoken language is English, though I know a little bit of French. After graduating from high school in 2015, I went on to complete an Advanced Diploma of Professional Game Development & Graduate Diploma of Management from 2016-2018. Since then, I’ve worked as an independent game developer. My hobbies and interests include gaming, modern history, video editing, music & film.</p>
        <p>Fun fact, I’m also really into tabletop roleplaying games! I almost always have at least one ongoing game running as either a player or a GM, and enjoy a variety of games including Dungeons & Dragons(5E), Pathfinder, World Of Darkness(WoD & CofD), Star Wars (Fantasy Flight) & Warhammer 40K (Only War & Dark Heresy).</p>

        <p>My name is Dominic Grkow (s3945746), I’m originally from “windy” Wellington, New Zealand in which I lived there for seven years, I am also part Irish, Macedonian and Polish. For a drastic change my family and I moved to Poland 17803 km away, in a small town called Czestochowa were I attended primary school. Then we finally situated in Melbourne, Australia were i finished my primary school and secondary college education. In the free time I enjoy having a hit of tennis which I have been playing for around ten years, in addition, I’ve played Alto Saxophone since I was 12 years old and studied it in my final year of secondary college which was a challenge during lockdown. My interest in IT started in primary school where I would have weekly IT classes and would always look forward to it. I truly settled IT as a career choice in the future in year 10 of secondary college. Seeing lines of code turn into a fully functional program was truly fascinating to me. Currently I’m interested in cyber security and software development as it has many options and pathways to go into in the future and that it’s a growing field to go into as we continually learn new thing to protect and develop different IT systems. So far, I’ve had some experience in IT learning to code in C++ and python as well as using Unity. </p>
